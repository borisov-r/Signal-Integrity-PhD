  author = {Bockelman, D.E. and Eisenstadt, W.R.},
  title = {Combined differential and common-mode scattering parameters: theory
	and simulation},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques},
  year = {1995},
  volume = {Vol.43},
  pages = {1530-1539},
  abstract = {A theory for combined differential and common-mode normalized power
	waves is developed in terms of even and odd mode impedances and propagation
	constants for a microwave coupled line system. These are related
	to even and odd-mode terminal currents and voltages. Generalized
	s-parameters of a two-port are developed for waves propagating in
	several coupled modes. The two-port s-parameters form a 4-by-4 matrix
	containing differential-mode, common-mode, and cross-mode s-parameters.
	A special case of the theory allows the use of uncoupled transmission
	lines to measure the coupled-mode waves. Simulations verify the concept
	of these mixed-mode s-parameters, and demonstrate conversion from
	mode to mode for asymmetric microwave structures},

  title = {Coupled mode analysis of forward and backward coupling in multiconductor
	transmission lines},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {Vol.47},
  pages = {463-470},
  abstract = {The nonorthogonal coupled mode theory is extended to the analysis
	of multiconductor transmission lines by including backward coupling.
	Coupling coefficients are expressed as overlap integrals of the eigenfields
	and currents belonging to individual lines. These eigenmode solutions
	are calculated using the finite-difference time-domain method, which
	can provide a broadband solution through a single simulation. General
	termination conditions are given, and scattering parameters of a
	multiconductor transmission line can be obtained directly by solving
	the coupled mode equations subject to these termination conditions.
	As illustrative examples, several configurations of coupled microstrip
	lines are analyzed, and numerical results are presented. It is observed
	that both the forward and backward coupling results agree fairly
	well with results from Advanced Design System Momentum software.},

  title = {Radiated susceptibility on the printed-circuit-board level: simulation
	and measurement},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {Vol.47},
  pages = {471-478},
  abstract = {The electromagnetic field coupling into the traces on a printed circuit
	board (PCB) is investigated. Based on a simplified equivalent-wire
	model, a practical simulation method is presented, which enables
	an efficient treatment by the method of moment, with minimum computational
	and modeling effort. Validation by analytic and measurement results
	shows an acceptable accuracy within the limits of quasi-TEM propagation.
	The gigahertz transverse electromagnetic cell is found to be a suitable
	means for measuring the field coupling into PCBs. To reduce additional
	common-mode coupling, special care has to be taken for the length
	of the measurement cable connected to the PCB within the cell.},

	interconnects},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {Vol.50},
  pages = {1127-1136},
  abstract = {A device-level simulation is presented for studying wave propagation
	along metal-insulator-semiconductor interconnects. A set of nonlinear
	equations is first formulated by combining the motion equations of
	charged carriers and Maxwell's equations. The set of nonlinear equations
	is then transformed into the frequency domain, which leads to sets
	of nonlinear equations for the fundamental mode and its harmonics.
	Finally, the sets of nonlinear equations in the frequency domain
	are discretized using the finite-element method and solved using
	Newton's iterations. Special numerical enhancements are implemented
	to speed up the computational convergence and handle the boundary
	layer nature of the problem under study. This device-level simulation
	provides knowledge on field-carrier interactions, semiconductor substrate
	loss, and nonlinearity, as well as slow-wave and screening effects
	of charged carriers. This device-level simulation scheme enables
	a rigorous full-wave study of nonlinearity effects that arise from
	semiconductor substrates. Numerical examples for some practical material
	and geometrical parameters are included to illustrate capabilities
	and efficiency of the proposed device-level simulation scheme},
