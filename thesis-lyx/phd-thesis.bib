	implementing a penalty on abrupt spatial variations of the currents
	is proposed to alleviate this difficulty. Various schemes to mesh
	the equivalent current distribution are also explored. Combining
	these with measurements, it is shown that accurate estimation of
	equivalent current models can be achieved, thereby allowing the identification
	of the emission sources. The method is tested for different circuit
	configurations with both synthetic and real data. Obtained results
	demonstrate the efficiency of the method.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a detailed design and modeling approach for power

	These novel power planes, which were introduced recently, have the
	unique ability of providing effective broadband simultaneous switching
	noise (SSN) mitigation. Full-wave electromagnetic simulation is used
	to study the impact of the geometry on the performance of these novel
	power planes. It is demonstrated that power planes using inductance-enhanced
	HIS can be designed for broadband mitigation of the SSN from the
	upper hundred megahertz to the gigahertz frequencies. Physics-based
	compact models for the unit cell of power planes with integrated
	HIS are developed and several of them connected in a two-dimensional
	array to build full models for large and multilayer power planes.
	The compact model offers fast analysis of power planes. As an example,
	we show that the full-wave simulation time of a 10×10 cm power plane
	with integrated HIS can be dramatically reduced from 24 to 48 h using
	a commercially available three-dimensional full-wave solver to less
