  abstract = {A device-level simulation is presented for studying wave propagation
	along metal-insulator-semiconductor interconnects. A set of nonlinear
	equations is first formulated by combining the motion equations of
	charged carriers and Maxwell's equations. The set of nonlinear equations
	is then transformed into the frequency domain, which leads to sets
	of nonlinear equations for the fundamental mode and its harmonics.
	Finally, the sets of nonlinear equations in the frequency domain
	are discretized using the finite-element method and solved using
	Newton's iterations. Special numerical enhancements are implemented
	to speed up the computational convergence and handle the boundary
	layer nature of the problem under study. This device-level simulation
	provides knowledge on field-carrier interactions, semiconductor substrate
	loss, and nonlinearity, as well as slow-wave and screening effects
	of charged carriers. This device-level simulation scheme enables
	a rigorous full-wave study of nonlinearity effects that arise from
	semiconductor substrates. Numerical examples for some practical material
	and geometrical parameters are included to illustrate capabilities
	and efficiency of the proposed device-level simulation scheme},
