  title = {Combined differential and common-mode scattering parameters: theory
	and simulation},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques},
  year = {1995},
  volume = {Vol.43},
  pages = {1530-1539},
  abstract = {A theory for combined differential and common-mode normalized power
	waves is developed in terms of even and odd mode impedances and propagation
	constants for a microwave coupled line system. These are related
	to even and odd-mode terminal currents and voltages. Generalized
	s-parameters of a two-port are developed for waves propagating in
	several coupled modes. The two-port s-parameters form a 4-by-4 matrix
	containing differential-mode, common-mode, and cross-mode s-parameters.
	A special case of the theory allows the use of uncoupled transmission
	lines to measure the coupled-mode waves. Simulations verify the concept
	of these mixed-mode s-parameters, and demonstrate conversion from
	mode to mode for asymmetric microwave structures},

	transmission lines},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {Vol.47},
  pages = {463-470},
  abstract = {The nonorthogonal coupled mode theory is extended to the analysis
	of multiconductor transmission lines by including backward coupling.
	Coupling coefficients are expressed as overlap integrals of the eigenfields
	and currents belonging to individual lines. These eigenmode solutions
	are calculated using the finite-difference time-domain method, which
	can provide a broadband solution through a single simulation. General
	termination conditions are given, and scattering parameters of a
	multiconductor transmission line can be obtained directly by solving
	the coupled mode equations subject to these termination conditions.
	As illustrative examples, several configurations of coupled microstrip
	lines are analyzed, and numerical results are presented. It is observed
	that both the forward and backward coupling results agree fairly
	well with results from Advanced Design System Momentum software.},

  title = {Design and modeling of high-impedance electromagnetic surfaces for
	switching noise suppression in power planes},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility},
  volume = {Vol.47},
  pages = {479-489},
  abstract = {This paper presents a detailed design and modeling approach for power
	planes with integrated high-impedance electromagnetic surfaces (HIS).
	These novel power planes, which were introduced recently, have the
	unique ability of providing effective broadband simultaneous switching
	noise (SSN) mitigation. Full-wave electromagnetic simulation is used
	to study the impact of the geometry on the performance of these novel
	power planes. It is demonstrated that power planes using inductance-enhanced
	HIS can be designed for broadband mitigation of the SSN from the
	upper hundred megahertz to the gigahertz frequencies. Physics-based
	compact models for the unit cell of power planes with integrated
	HIS are developed and several of them connected in a two-dimensional
	array to build full models for large and multilayer power planes.
	The compact model offers fast analysis of power planes. As an example,
	we show that the full-wave simulation time of a 10×10 cm power plane
	with integrated HIS can be dramatically reduced from 24 to 48 h using
	a commercially available three-dimensional full-wave solver to less
	than 1 min when using the compact circuit model developed here.},

  pages = {1127-1136},
  abstract = {A device-level simulation is presented for studying wave propagation
	along metal-insulator-semiconductor interconnects. A set of nonlinear
	equations is first formulated by combining the motion equations of
	charged carriers and Maxwell's equations. The set of nonlinear equations

	of nonlinear equations for the fundamental mode and its harmonics.
	Finally, the sets of nonlinear equations in the frequency domain
	are discretized using the finite-element method and solved using
	Newton's iterations. Special numerical enhancements are implemented
	to speed up the computational convergence and handle the boundary
	layer nature of the problem under study. This device-level simulation
	provides knowledge on field-carrier interactions, semiconductor substrate
	loss, and nonlinearity, as well as slow-wave and screening effects
	of charged carriers. This device-level simulation scheme enables
	a rigorous full-wave study of nonlinearity effects that arise from
