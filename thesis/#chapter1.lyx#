В повечето случаи под сигнална интегрираност (СИ) (Signal Integrity - SI)
 се разбира анализ, дизайн и валидиране на връзките между отделни схеми
 с цел успешно предаване на цифрови сигнали.
 За тази цел СИ взима идеи и практики от различни части на електроинженерството.
 Хората незапознати с аналоговата и радио електроника и тяхното разнообразие,
 може да сметнат СИ за мистерия, понякога дори непоследователна, а често
 и трудна за разбиране.
 Дизайнерите на цифрова логика, които са свикнали да работят с двоична логика
 и схеми, често я смятат за неточна, а аналоговата природа на сигналната
 интегрираност за разочароваща.
 При анализа, познанията в RF и аналоговата електроника помагат, но съвременните
 CAD системи позволяват на всеки да създаде симулация на СИ и да предвиди
 работата на схемата.
 Въпреки това, като цяло разработчиците на CAD софтуер не винаги рекламират
 или понякога не разбират напълно ограниченията на техните продукти.
 Използван експертно софтуера може да бъде много мощно средство за анализ,
 но ако бъде използван неправилно, то има значителни последствия.
 Инженерите занимаващи се със СИ и мениджърите, работещи с предаване на
 импулсни сигнали, могат да избегнат грешки, ако знаят основините принципи
 свързани със сигналната интегрираност.

The First Transatlantic Telegraph Cable Managers and engineers not having
 a fundamental understanding of the technical principles governing a project
 are more likely to make serious technical mistakes, especially when pushing
 the state of the art.
 Perhaps the first time this became ap- parent with regards to a significant
 high-speed signaling project occurred on August 16, 1858.
 That was when Great Britain’s Queen Victoria sent a welcoming message to
 U.S.
 President Buchanan over the first successfully laid transatlantic telegraph
 cable [2–4].
 This 3,800-km (about 2,400-mile) length of submarine cable connected

12 Introduction to Signal Integrity Ireland with Newfoundland and could
 not be financially viable unless it operated at speeds similar to dry land
 telegraph cables.
 Unfortunately, signal integrity problems caused the Queen’s 99-word inaugural
 message to take nearly 17 hours for trans- mission instead of several minutes
 as had been expected [2].
 The roots of this nineteenth-century disaster are both managerial and technical.
 The underlying management fault was that the investors and managers did
 not possess a rudimentary understanding of telegraphy.
 Because of this they hired a chief electri- cian lacking a thorough background
 in electrical engineering or telegraphy theory.
 This decision was at the root of the cable’s technical flaws.
 Without this knowledge the chief electrician was unable to understand the
 latest technical developments and instead relied on his intuition to design
 the cable and instrument set.
 These intuitive designs were appealing to management but inappropriate
 for the task.
 Some outside experts (most notably Professor William Thompson, later to
 be Lord Kelvin) had questioned the cable’s electrical design and the electrical
 equip- ment to be used with it.
 With his theoretical background, Thompson knew that the electrical characterist
ics of a long submarine cable were significantly different from the open
 air cable that had earlier been used in proof-of-concept experiments, and
 he correctly believed that the submarine cable would distort high-speed
 Morse code pulses.
 He preferred another cable design and suggested transmitting and re- ceiving
 equipment with very different electrical characteristics than the equipment
 designed by the chief electrician.
 Because of management’s weak technical back- ground, they were unable to
 ask the kinds of probing, focused questions needed to resolve the technical
 debate between Thompson and the chief electrician.
 After several false starts, the intuitively designed but electrically flawed
 cable was finally laid, and direct current from a battery in Ireland was
 detected by instru- ments in Newfoundland.
 This low-frequency test seemed to vindicate the design, but it was soon
 discovered that high-speed pulses could not be properly received.
 In fact, signaling was only possible at speeds that were far too slow to
 be profitable.
 Management was unable to properly judge the merits of the various approach-
 es to debug suggested by staff.
 Instead of using the sensitive transmitting and re- ceiving instruments
 purposed by Thompson (which we now know would have significantly improved
 the signaling speed), they authorized the chief electrician to increase
 the voltage of the transmitted pulses.
 The misguided idea was that the higher voltage would “push” the pulses
 down the cable with greater force, allow- ing signaling to occur at high
 speeds.
 In fact, this did not improve the signaling rate because the fundamental
 problem was pulse distortion caused by the cable’s large RC delay, not
 signal strength.
 The large RC delay was the critical difference between the dry-land cables
 used during the proof-of-concept experiments and the submarine cable.
 The dry-air cables used air as insulation, but the submarine cable used
 a waterproof insulation that greatly increased the capacitance.
 We will return to this effect in Section 1.7.
 The large RC delay so distorted the pulses that only the slowest of them
 could be properly received.
 Modern SI engineers would say that intersymbol interference was created
 by the way in which the cable attenuated high frequencies (the high- speed
 Morse pulses) but allowed low frequencies (slow speed pulses, including1.3
 What Is a Pulse? 3 the battery’s DC) to pass.
 As we will see in later chapters, this same behavior also occurs when signaling
 over modern circuit board traces.
 During debug the sending voltage was incrementally increased to excessively
 high values in an unfortunate attempt to improve signaling speed.
 This destroyed the cable within a month of the Queen’s inaugural message.
 In fact, the cable never sent any commercial telegrams and was a financial
 failure that set off investigations of financial fraud and technical mismanagem
ent and ruined several careers.
 Modern SI engineers and those who manage them can avoid the kinds of sys-
 temic problems experienced during the 1858 cable project by learning the
 ways in which pulses misbehave when traveling along long lines and learning
 techniques for correcting these types of errors.
 We begin by defining a pulse, then examine the time and frequency domains,
 and describe two of the most important physical constants used in signal
 integrity work.
 We conclude by briefly discussing the effects that many drivers simultane-
 ously switching have on power supply noise.

Transmission Line Fundamentals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As illustrated in Figure 6.1, a transmission line is formed with two or more
 con- ductors.
 The signal conductor carries the signal energy from a generator to a load,
 and the second conductor (the return) completes the circuit by returning
 the signal current back to the generator.
 The signal conductor could be a microstrip trace and the return path the
 underlying ground plane.
 The generator is any signal launching device, such as an ASIC I/O driver.

\begin_layout Subsection
What Is the Signal Return Path?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frequently, signal integrity engineers speak of the “signal return path,”
 but often it is taken for granted and not fully understood.
 Studying the return path is impor- tant because it determines the trace’s
 capacitance, inductance, resistance, and noise coupling.
 Because capacitance is often more intuitive than inductance, we will ignore
 inductance for now and focus on the importance of the return path in determin-
 ing the capacitance.
 Resistance is also affected by the return path, but we will wait until
 Chapters 7 and 8 to discuss this important topic.
