  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a rigorous field theoretical analysis of slow wave mode propagation in coplanar waveguide (CPW) metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) transmission lines with a laterally confined doping profile. Two types of transmission line structures are investigated-bulk silicon and semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI). In both cases a Gaussian profile of the doping depth is assumed. It was found that an optimum lateral width of the doping region exists for which both structures exhibit a much better slow wave factor at lower losses than traditional thin-film MIS transmission lines. The abrupt transition between MIS, CPW, and CPW on a normal insulating substrate was investigated as well. It was found that the reflection coefficient increases significantly with frequency and when the lateral width of the doping region is extended over the whole cross section of the CPW. The investigation was carried out using the frequency-domain transmission line modeling (TLM) (FDTLM) method},

Updated and extensively revised, this second edition includes a new chapter on 1D FEM analysis, and extended 3D treatments of the FDTD, MoM and FEM, with entirely new 3D MATLAB codes. Coverage of higher-order finite elements in 1D, 2D and 3D is also provided, with supporting code, in addition to a detailed 1D example of the FDTD from a FEM perspective. With running examples through the book and end-of-chapter problems to aid understanding, this is ideal for professional engineers and senior undergraduate/graduate students who need to master CEM and avoid common pitfalls in writing code and using existing software.},

Now, we are reintroducing the printed books to the trade, fully corrected, for the first time ever, and in collaboration with Caltech.

At 61.5 GHz, the two-stage LNA achieves 4.5-dB NF, 15-dB gain, consuming 6 mA from 1.8 V. This is the first known demonstration of a silicon LNA at V-band. The downconverter consists of a preamplifier, I/Q double-balanced mixers, a frequency tripler, and a quadrature generator, and is again the first known demonstration of silicon active mixers at V-band. At 60 GHz, the downconverter gain is 18.6 dB and the NF is 13.3 dB, and the circuit consumes 55 mA from 2.7 V, while the output buffers consume an additional 52 mA. The balanced class-AB PA provides 10.8-dB gain, +11.2-dBm 1-dB compression point, 4.3% maximum PAE, and 16-dBm saturated output power. Finally, fully differential Colpitts VCOs have been implemented at 22 and 67 GHz. The 67-GHz VCO has a phase noise better than -98 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset, and provides a 3.1% tuning range for 8-mA current consumption from a 3-V supply.},

A transverse DC bias condition is applied. Structures numerically simulated are a voltage-variable GaAs distributed Schottky-barrier phase shifter and a transmission line over an Si bipolar junction. Numerical data based on a finite-difference technique are generated on carrier densities, electric potentials and fields, and current densities. Propagation constant calculations compared favorably to those calculated by both full-wave field analysis and moments-of-the-Boltzmann-equation analysis for some less general cases. Propagation constant results for the GaAs structure are compared with available experimental data, and good agreement is obtained.<>},

This book reviews the fundamentals of electromagnetism in passive and active circuit elements, highlighting various effects and potential problems in designing a new circuit.

Using examples and applications in RF and microwave systems, the author describes transmission lines, transformers, and distributed circuits. State-of-the-art developments in Si based broadband analog, RF, microwave, and mm-wave circuits are reviewed. With up-to-date results, techniques, practical examples, illustrations and worked examples, this book will be valuable to advanced undergraduate and graduate students of electrical engineering, and practitioners in the IC design industry.

The effect of homogeneous versus gradually inhomogeneous doping profile is investigated as well as the influence of the metal conductor losses and finite metallization thickness on the slow-wave factor and the overall losses. Numerical results indicate that thick-film MIS CPWs can support a slow-wave mode with moderate loss up to 40 GHz when the line dimensions are kept in the micrometer range. Furthermore, it is found that an inhomogeneous doping profile can reduce the overall losses and that the effect of metal conductor losses in heavily doped MIS structures is only marginal. On the other hand, in weakly doped or insulating GaAs material a lossy metal conductor leads to a higher propagation constant, exhibiting a negative slope with increasing frequency},
